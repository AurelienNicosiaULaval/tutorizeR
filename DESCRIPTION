Description: Converts existing .Rmd or .qmd analysis documents into interactive
    learnr tutorials (.Rmd).  Each original code chunk becomes an exercise
    followed by a solution chunk (gradethis ready).  Optionally, skeleton
    multiple-choice questions are inserted.  Setup chunks are preserved
    verbatim, and every generated tutorial is rendered once to ensure it
    compiles without error.
